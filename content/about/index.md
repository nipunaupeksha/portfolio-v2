Hi! I'm Nipuna Upeksha, and I love programming and learning new technologies. I started programming back in 2015 when I was selected to pursue my BSc. (Engineering) in **Electronics and Telecommunication Engineering specializing in Biomedical Engineering at University of Moratuwa**

Fast-forward to today, I had the privilege of working at **Sanota** as a Electronic and Software Trainee Developer, and I'm currently working as a Software Engineer at **WSO2.** My main focus these days is building highly scalable, security-oriented Identity and Access Management solutions.

Here is a list of the technologies I've been using recently.
