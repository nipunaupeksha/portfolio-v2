WSO2 Identity Server is one of the most popular Identity and Access Management solutions in the industry. It provides multiple features like user provisioning, inbound and outbound authentication, identity provider onboarding, single sign on, etc. To enhance the capabilities of IS, we are developing an organization management feature which is similar to the current WSO2 Asgardeo. 
In the traditional IS multitenacy is used out of the box to manage user identities and access management policies.
However, the multitenacy architecture cannot define relationships between tenants and resouce sharing between tenants. To achieve that, we are building the organization management feature. It will be avaiable with WSO2 IS 6.0.0
