K-Means clustering was a common unsupervised learning approach that most people do to identify the clusters that present in a dataset. In this case, a large number of tweets were taken into account to find the clusters that people most commonly tweet about.

First, the dataset was cleaned and a corpus was made to analyze the data, then that corpus is lemmatized. After that, exploratory data analysis was done using python libraries,***matplotlib*** and ***seaborn***. After that, **TfIdf Vecotorization** and **Elbow Method** were used to retrieve the clusters.

In addition to the above-mentioned several python libraries including ***pandas, numpy, nltk*** were used in this project.
