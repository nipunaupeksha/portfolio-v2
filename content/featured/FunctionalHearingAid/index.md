Since good quality hearing aid are quite expensive, this project was initiated as the first step of making a good quality hearing aid locally. Implemented several algorithms including, dual adaptive filter method for feedback cancellation, coherence algorithm for adaptive directionality using two omnidirectional microphones, adaptive filter methods for noise cancellations(LMS, NLMS, ANLMS, RLS, AFA) and frequency shaper function for gain controlling.
