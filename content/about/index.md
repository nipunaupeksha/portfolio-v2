Hello! Interestingly, I got introduced to programming after A/Ls, when I started to follow **CMJD** course at **IJSE**. After that I had the privilege of joining the most prestigious engineering university in Sri Lanka, **University of Moratuwa**, where I followed my passion in programming.

Fast-forward to today, I'm currently working as a Software Engineer at **WSO2.** My responsibilty includes Java/Spring based microservices development & testing. 

I also love to try new frameworks, libraries and programming languges during my leisure time and write blogs to share what I've learnt.

Here is a list of the technologies that I'm familiar with!
